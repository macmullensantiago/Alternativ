        The answer is that once you start meditating, breathing is no

        dramatically.

   ## Synchronicity
       Del libro Sincronicidad
      * 'On Synchronicity' (1951) (CW 8)1
        It might seem appropriate to begin my exposition by defining the concept
        with which it deals. But I would rather approach the subject the other way
        and first give you a brief description of the facts which the concept of
        synchronicity is intended to cover. As its etyn1ology shows, this term has
        something to do with time or, to be more accurate, with a kind of
        simultaneity. Instead of simultaneity we could also use the concept of a
        meaningful coincidence of two or more events, where something other than
        the probability of chance is involved.
        
        On April 1, 1949, I made a note in the morning of an inscription
        containing a figu re that was half man and half fish. There was fish for
        lunch. Somebody mentioned the custom of making an 'April fish' of
        someone. In the afternoon, a forn1er patient of mine, whom I had not seen
        for months, showed me some impressive pictures of fish. Tn the evening,
        I was shown a piece of embroidery with sea monsters and fishes in it. The
        next morning, l saw a former patient, who was visiting me for the fi rst
        tin1e in ten years. She had dreamed of a large fish the night before. A few
        months later, when I was using this series for a larger work and had just
        finished writing it down, I walked over to a spot by the lake in front of the
        house, where l had already been several times that morning. This time a
        fish a foot long Jay on the sea-wall. Since no one else was present, I have
        no idea how the fish could have got there.
        
        The sentiment du deja-vu is based, as I have found in a number of cases,
        on a foreknowledge in dreams, but we saw that this foreknowledge can
        also occur in the waking state. In such cases mere chance becomes highly
        improbable because the coincidence is known in advance. It thus loses its
        chance character not only psychologically and subjectively, but objectively
        too, since the accumulation of details that coincide immeasurably
        increases the improbability of chance as a determining factor.
        
        Well, I was sitting opposite her one day, with my
        back to the window, listening to her flow of rhetoric. She had had an
        impressive drea1n the night before, in which someone had given her a
        golden scarab - a costly piece of jewellery. While she was still telling me
        this dream, I heard so1nething behind me gently tapping on the window. I
        turned round and saw that it was a fairly large flying insect that was
        knocking against the window-pane from outside in the obvious effort to
        get into the dark room. This seemed to me very strange. I opened the
        window immediately and caught the insect in the air as it flew in. It was
        a scarabaeid beetle, or common rose-chafer ( Cetonia aura ta), whose goldgreen
        colour most nearly resembles that of a golden scarab. I handed the
        beetle to my patient with the words, 'Here is your scarab.' This experience
        punctured the desired hole in her rationalism and broke the ice of her
        intellectual resistance. The treatment could now be continued with satisfactory
        results.
        
        All the phenomena(clairvoyance, telepathy, etc.,) I have mentioned can be grouped under three
        categories:
        1 The coincidence of a psychic state in the observer with a simultaneous,
        objective, external event that corresponds to the psychic state or content
        (e.g., the scarab), where there is no evidence of a causal connection
        between the psychic state and the external event, and where, considering
        the psychic relativity of space and time, such a connection is not even
        conceivable.
        2 The coincidence of a psychic state with a corresponding (more or less
        simultaneous) external event taking place outside the observer's field of
        perception, i.e., at a distance, and only verifiable afterward (e.g., the
        Stockholm fire).
        3 The coincidence of a psychic state with a corresponding, not yet existent
        future event that is distant in time and can likewise on ly be verified
        afterward.
        
        Consequently. we are no
        longer justified in describing astrology as a mantic method. Astrology is
        in the process of becoming a science.
        
        (...) a meaningful coincidence, that is. as synchronicity.
        
        Causality is the way we explain
        the link between two successive events. Synchronicity designates the
        parallelism of time and meaning between psychic and psychophysical
        events, which scientific knowledge so far has been unable to reduce to a
        common principle. The term explains nothing, it si,nply formulates the
        occurrence of meaningful coincidences which, in themselves. are chance
        happenings, but are so improbable that we must assume them to be based
        on some kind of principle, or on some property of the empirical world. No
        reciprocal causal connection can be shown to obtain between parallel
        events, which is just what gives them their chance character. The only
        recognizable and demonstrable link between them is a common meaning,
        or equivalence. The old theory of correspondence was based on the
        experience of such connections - a theory that reached its culminating
        point and also its provisional end in Leibniz' idea of pre-established
        harmony, and was then replaced by causality. Synchronicity is a modern
        differentiation of the obsolete concept of correspondence, sympathy, and
        harmony. Tt is based not on philosophical assumptions but on empirical
        experience and experimentation.
        
        This paper was inevitable.
        Having come to the conclusion that the observed is also a disturbance by the
        observer, the consistent investigator of the unknown interior of the atom
        could not help seeing that the nature of the observing process becon1es
        perceptible in the disturbance caused by the observation. To put it more
        simply, if you look long enough into a dark hole you perceive what is looking
        in.
        This is also the principle of cognition in yoga, which derives all cognition
        from the absolute emptiness of consciousness. This method of cognition
        is thus a special instance of the introspective investigation of the psyche
        in general.
        
        lt may be said in passing that Chinese science is based on
        the principle of synchronicity.

        Then the whole sea turned to blood.
        
        There was no longer anything I wanted or desired. I existed
        in an objective form; I was what I had been and lived. At first the sense of
        annihilation predominated, of having been stripped or pillaged; but suddenly
        that became of no consequence. Everything seemed to be past; what remained
        was afait accompli, without any reference back to what had been. There was
        no longer any regret that something had dropped away or been taken away.
        On the contrary: I had everything that I was, and that was everything.
        
        'Why does he always pretend he doesn't know he is a basileus of Kos?
        
        I felt as though I were floating in space, as
        though I were safe in the womb of the universe - in a tremendous void, but
        filled with the highest possible feeling of happiness. 'This is eternal bliss', I
        thought. 'This cannot be described; it is far too wonderful!'

        I would never have imagined that any such experience was possible. It was
        not a product of imagination. The visions and experiences were utterly real;
        there was nothing subjective about them; they all had a quality of absolute
        objectivity.
        
        We shy away fron1 the word 'eternal', but I can describe the experience
        only as the ecstasy of a non-temporal state in which present, past, and future
        are one. Everything that happens in time had been brought together into a
        concrete whole. Nothing was distributed over time, nothing could be measured
        by temporal concepts. The experience might best be defined as a state
        of feeling, but one which cannot be produced by itnagination. How can I
        imagine that I exist sin1ultaneously the day before yesterday, to-day and the
        day after to-morrow? There would be things which would not yet have begun,
        other things which would be indubitably present, and others again which
        would already be finished - and yet all this would be one. The only thing that
        feeling could grasp would be a sum, an iridescent whole, containing all at
        once expectation of a beginning, surprise at what is now happening, and
        satisfaction or disappointment with the result of what happened. One is
        interwoven into an indescribable whole and yet observes it with complete
        objectivity.
        
        I got out at Erlenbach and walked home, still troubled by this memory. My
        second daughter's children were in the garden. The family was living with
        us, having returned to Switzerland from Paris because of the war. The
        children stood looking rather upset, and when J asked, 'Why, what is the
        matter?' they told me that Adrian, then the youngest of the boys, had fallen
        into the water in the boathouse. It is quite deep there, and since he could not
        really swim he had almost drowned. His older brother had fished him out.
        This had taken place at exactly the time 1 had been assailed by that memory
        in the train. The unconscious had given me a hint. Why should it not be able
        to inform me of other things also?
        
        Naturally, one can contend from the start that myths and dreams concerning
        continuity of life after death are merely compensating fantasies which are
        inherent in our natures - all life desires eternity. The only argument I can
        adduce in answer to this is the myth itself.
        However. there are indications that at least a part of the psyche is not
        subject to the laws of space and time. Scientific proof of that has been
        provided by the well-known J.B. Rhine experiments.2 Along with numerous
        cases of spontaneous foreknowledge, non-spatial perceptions, and so on - of
        which I have given a number of examples from my own life - these
        experiments prove that the psyche at times functions outside of the spatiotemporal
        law of causality. This indicates that our conceptions of space and
        ti1ne, and therefore of causality also, are incomplete. A complete picture of
        the world would require the addition of still another dimension; only then
        could the totality of phenomena be given a unified explanation.
        
        In himself he is an important god - a Mercury
        or Hermes, as the Romans correctly realized, a nature spirit who returned to
        life again in the Merlin of the Grail legend and became, as the spiritus
        Mercurialis, the sought-after arcanum of the alche1uists.
        
        To these two causal relationships
        we must add a third possibility, namely, that of a 'synchronistic',
        i.e., acausal, meaningful coincidence - a problem that has occupied men's
        minds ever since the time of Geulincx, Le ibniz and Schopenhauer.
        
        In the latter case one could
        assume that synchronicity is a property of energy, but in so far as energy is
        equal 10 matter it is a seconda ry effect of the primary coincidence of mental
        and physical events (as in the Fibonacci series). The hridge seems to be
        formed by the numbers.~ Numbers are just as much invented as they are
        discovered as natural facts, like all true archetypes. As far as I know,
        archetypes arc perhaps the most important basis for synchronistic events.
        
        Man created mathematics, but God created whole
        numbers: o 0Eo<; &pL0μ:r11£~EL.
        
        The mandala symbolizes, by its central point, the ultimate unity of all
        archetypes as well as of the multiplicity of the phenomenal world, and is
        therefore the empirical equivalent of the metaphysical concept of a unus
        mundus. The alchemical equivalent is the lapis and its synonyms, in
        particular the Microcosm.
        
        The essential thing about
        these phenomena is that an objective event coincides meaningfully with a
        psychic process; that is to say. a physical event and an endopsychic one have
        a common meaning.
        
        Unconscious synchronicities
        are, as we know from experience, altogether possible, since in many
        cases we are unconscious of their happening, or have to have our attention
        drawn to the coincidence by an outsider.
        
        Del libro Syncrhronicity an accausal connecting principle
        To Jung, synchronicity is a meaningful coincidence in time, a psychic factor
        which is independent of space and time. This revolutionary concept of
        synchronicity both challenges and complements the physicist’s classical view of
        causality. It also forces us to a basic reconsideration of the meaning of change,
        probability, coincidence and the singular events in our lives.
        
        The suspicion that this must be a case of meaningful coincidence, i.e., an
        acausal connection, is very natural.
        
        Schopenhauer believed in
        the absolute determinism of the natural process and furthermore in a first cause.
        
        I defined synchronicity as a psychically
        conditioned relativity of space and time.
        
        Synchronicity therefore means the simultaneous occurrence of a certain
        psychic state with one or more external events which appear as meaningful
        parallels to the momentary subjective state—and, in certain cases, vice versa. My
        two examples illustrate this in different ways. In the case of the scarab the
        simultaneity is immediately obvious, but not in the second example. It is true that
        the flock of birds occasioned a vague fear, but that can be explained causally. The
        wife of my patient was certainly not conscious beforehand of any fear that could
        be compared with my own apprehensions, for the symptoms (pains in the throat)
        were not of a kind to make the layman suspect anything bad. The unconscious,
        however, often knows more than the conscious, and it seems to me possible that
        the woman’s unconscious had already got wind of the danger.
        
        Synchronistic events rest on the simultaneous occurrence of two different
        psychic states. One of them is the normal, probable state (i.e., the one that is
        causally explicable), and the other, the critical experience, is the one that cannot
        be derived causally from the first. In the case of sudden death the critical
        experience cannot be recognized immediately as “extra-sensory perception” but
        can only be verified as such afterwards. Yet even in the case of the “scarab” what
        is immediately experienced is a psychic state or psychic image which differs from
        the dream image only because it can be verified immediately.
        
        The scarab dream is a conscious representation arising
        from an unconscious, already existing image of the situation that will occur on
        the following day, i.e., the recounting of the dream and the appearance of the
        rose-chafer.
        
        Synchronicity therefore consists of two factors: a) An unconscious image comes
        into consciousness either directly (i.e., literally) or indirectly (symbolized or
        suggested) in the form of a dream, idea, or premonition. b) An objective situation
        coincides with this content. The one is as puzzling as the other. How does the
        unconscious image arise, and how the coincidence? I understand only too well
        why people prefer to doubt the reality of these things. Here I will only pose the
        question. Later in the course of this study I will try to give an answer.
        
        Goethe thinks of synchronistic events in the same “magical” way.
        Thus he says, in his conversations with Eckermann: “We all have certain electric
        and magnetic powers within us and ourselves exercise an attractive and repelling
        force, according as we come into touch with something like or unlike.”
        
        The method, like all divinatory or intuitive techniques, is based on an acausal
        or synchronistic connective principle.
        
        Number has invariably been used to describe some numinous
        object, and all numbers from 1 to 9 are “sacred,” just as 10, 12, 13, 14, 28, 32, and
        40 have a special significance. The most elementary quality about an object is
        whether it is one or many. Number helps more than anything else to bring order
        into the chaos of appearances. It is the predestined instrument for creating order,
        or for apprehending an already existing, but still unknown, regular arrangement
        or “orderedness.” It may well be the most primitive element of order in the
        human mind, seeing that the numbers 1 to 4 occur with the greatest frequency
        and have the widest incidence. In other words, primitive patterns of order are
        mostly triads or tetrads. That numbers have an archetypal foundation is not, by
        the way, a conjecture of mine but of certain mathematicians, as we shall see in
        due course.
        
        Hence it is not such an audacious conclusion after all if we define
        number psychologically as an archetype of order which has become conscious.68
        Remarkably enough, the psychic pictures of wholeness which are spontaneously
        produced by the unconscious, the symbols of the self in mandala form, also have
        a mathematical structure. They are as a rule quaternities (or their multiples).69
        These structures not only express order, they also create it. That is why they
        generally appear in times of psychic disorientation in order to compensate a
        chaotic state or as formulations of numinous experiences. It must be emphasized
        yet again that they are not inventions of the conscious mind but are spontaneous
        products of the unconscious, as has been sufficiently shown by experience.
        
        The causality principle asserts that the connection between cause and effect is a
        necessary one. The synchronicity principle asserts that the terms of a meaningful
        coincidence are connected by simultaneity and meaning.
        
        In Chinese philosophy one of the oldest and most central ideas is that of Tao,
        which the Jesuits translated as “God.” But that is correct only for the Western
        way of thinking. Other translations, such as “Providence” and the like, are mere
        makeshifts. Richard Wilhelm brilliantly interprets it as “meaning.”2 The concept
        of Tao pervades the whole philosophical thought of China.
        
        Lao-tzu gives the following description of Tao in his celebrated Tao Teh
        Ching:3
        There is something formless yet complete
        That existed before heaven and earth. How still how empty!
        Dependent on nothing, unchanging,
        All pervading, unfailing.
        One may think of it as the mother of all things under heaven.
        I do not know its name,
        But I call it “Meaning.”
        If I had to give it a name, I should call it “The Great.”
        
        Tao “covers the ten thousand things like a garment but does not claim to be
        master over them”.
        
        Tao never does;
        Yet through it all things are done.
        
        On the primitive level, of course, synchronicity does not
        appear as an idea by itself, but as “magical” causality. This is an early form of our
        classical idea of causality, while the development of Chinese philosophy
        produced from the connotation of the magical the “concept” of Tao, of
        meaningful coincidence, but no causality-based science.
        
        synchronicity is a phenomenon that
        seems to be primarily connected with psychic conditions, that is to say with
        processes in the unconscious. Synchronistic phenomena are found to occur—
        experimentally—with some degree of regularity and frequency in the intuitive,
        “magical” procedures, where they are subjectively convincing but are extremely
        difficult to verify objectively and cannot be statistically evaluated (at least at
        present).
        
        Synchronicity is not a philosophical view but an empirical concept which
        postulates an intellectually necessary principle. This cannot be called either
        materialism or metaphysics. No serious investigator would assert that the nature
        of what is observed to exist, and of that which observes, namely the psyche, are
        known and recognized quantities. If the latest conclusions of science are coming
        nearer and nearer to a unitary idea of being, characterized by space and time on
        the one hand and by causality and synchronicity on the other, that has nothing to
        do with materialism. Rather it seems to show that there is some possibility of
        getting rid of the incommensurability between the observed and the observer.
        
        ACAUSALITY. If natural law were an absolute truth, then of course there
        could not possibly be any processes that deviate from it. But since causality is a
        statistical truth, it holds good only on average and thus leaves room for
        exceptions which must somehow be experienceable, that is to say, real. I try to
        regard synchronistic events as acausal exceptions of this kind. They prove to be
        relatively independent of space and time; they relativize space and time in so far
        as space presents in principle no obstacle to their passage and the sequence of
        events in time is inverted, so that it looks as if an event which has not yet
        occurred were causing a perception in the present. But if space and time are
        relative, then causality too loses its validity, since the sequence of cause and
        effect is either relativized or abolished.
        
        SYNCHRONICITY. Despite my express warning I see that this concept has
        already been confused by the critics with synchronism. By synchronicity I mean
        the occurrence of a meaningful coincidence in time. It can take three forms:
        a) The coincidence of a certain psychic content with a corresponding objective
        process which is perceived to take place simultaneously.
        b) The coincidence of a subjective psychic state with a phantasm (dream or
        vision) which later turns out to be a more or less faithful reflection of a
        “synchronistic,” objective event that took place more or less simultaneously,
        but at a distance.
        c) The same, except that the event perceived takes place in the future and is
        represented in the present only by a phantasm that corresponds to it.
        Whereas in the first case an objective event coincides with a subjective content,
        the synchronicity in the other two cases can only be verified subsequently,
        though the synchronistic event as such is formed by the coincidence of a
        neutral psychic state with a phantasm (dream or vision).
        
        Las leyes naturales son verdades estadísticas, esto es, sólo son completamente
        válidas donde se trata de magnitudes macrofísicas,
        mientras que en el ámbito de las magnitudes ínfimas el pronóstico
        se vuelve incierto o imposible, por cuanto las magnitudes ínfimas
        no se conducen conforme a las leyes naturales conocidas.
        
        El principio filosófico en el cual se basa nuestra concepción
        de la legalidad natural es el de causalidad. Pero si el nexo entre
        causa y efecto posee una validez únicamente estadística, o sea,
        una verdad relativa, entonces también el mismo principio de
        causalidad tiene, en último término, una aplicación sólo relativa
        para la explicación de los procesos naturales, y supone, en
        consecuencia, la existencia de uno o varios otros factores, necesarios
        para una explicación adecuada. Lo que viene a significar que
        el nexo vigente entre ciertos sucesos puede ser en determinadas
        circunstancias de índole no causal, o sea, que exige otro principio
        explicativo.
        
        Ahora bien, hay en nuestra experiencia un campo de inmensa
        amplitud, cuya extensión equilibra, por así decirlo, la del dominio
        de la causalidad: es el mundo del azar1.
        
        Así, por ejemplo el señor Gross (grande)
        padece de megalomanía, el señor Kleiner (pequeño) tiene un complejo
        de inferioridad. Dos hermanas Altmann (hombre viejo) se casan ambas
        con hombres que les llevan veinte años de edad; el señor Feist (obeso)
        es ministro de alimentación; el señor Rosstäuscher (chalán tramposo) es
        abogado; el señor Kalberer (comadrón veterinario) es partero; el señor
        Freud (alegría) sostiene el principio del placer; el señor Adler (águila)
        sostiene la voluntad de poder; el señor Jung (joven) la idea de renacimiento,
        etc. ¿Trátase aquí de absurdos caprichos del azar o de un efecto
        sugestivo del nombre, como parece suponer Stekel, o de "coincidencias
        significativas"?
        
        En esta concepción, "el sujeto del gran sueño de la vida. . .
        es sólo uno", la voluntad trascendental, la prima causa de la
        cual irradian todas las series causales como meridianos desde
        el polo, guardando entre sí una significativa relación de simultaneidad
        en virtud de los círculos paralelos 11. Schopenhauer creía
        en el determinismo absoluto del proceso natural y también en una
        causa primera. Nada hay que confirme ninguno de los dos supuestos.
        La causa primera no es sino un mitologema filosófico que
        sólo merece fe donde aparece en la forma de la antigua paradoja
        (En to\ pa=n, a saber, como unidad y multiplicidad al mismo tiempo.
        
        Los acontecimientos sincronísticos se basan en la simultaneidad
        de dos diferentes estados psíquicos. Uno de ellos es el normal y
        probable (es decir, causalmente explicable); el otro, la vivencia
        crítica, es el estado que no cabe deducir causalmente del primero.
        
        El fenómeno de
        la sincronización consiste, por lo tanto, en dos factores: 1. Una
        imagen inconsciente entra en lo consciente directamente (es decir,
        literalmente) o indirectamente (simbolizada o insinuada) como
        sueño, ocurrencia o premonición. 2. Una situación objetiva coincide
        con ese contenido.
        
        "Encontré una explicación instructiva (de la magia) en el Liber
        sextus naturalium de Avicena, en el que se afirma que en el alma humana
        mora una cierta facultad (virtus) de cambiar las cosas y de subordinar
        a ella las demás cosas, en particular cuando es arrebatada por un gran
        exceso de amor u odio o algo semejante (quando ipsa fertur in magnum
        amoris excessum aut odii aut alicuius talium). Cuando, pues, el alma de
        un hombre es presa de un gran exceso de alguna pasión, puede probarse
        por el experimento que ése [el exceso] liga a las cosas [mágicamente]
        y las modifica en el sentido que desea (fertur in grandem excessum
        alicuius passionis invenitur experimento manifesto quod ipse ligat
        res et alterat ad idem quod desiderat et diu non credidi illud); por
        largo tiempo no lo quise creer, pero después de haber leído libros nigrománticos
        y otros sobre signos mágicos (imaginum) y magia, encontré
        que la emocionalidad (affectio) del alma humana es la raiz principal
        de todas esas cosas, ya sea porque debido a su gran emoción va alterando
        su cuerpo y las cosas a que tiende, ya sea porque a causa de su
        dignidad las otras cosas inferiores le están sujetas, ya sea porque la hora
        sideral apropiada o la situación astrológica o alguna otra fuerza coinciden
        con un tal afecto, que trasciende todos los límites, haciéndonos creer [en
        consecuencia] que todo cuanto haga esa fuerza es hecho por el alma
        (cum tali affectione exterminata concurrat hora conveniens aut ordo coelestis
        aut alia virtus, quae quodvis faciet, illud reputavimus tunc animam
        facere). .. Quien desee conocer el secreto de hacer y deshacer todo eso,
        debe saber que cualquiera puede influir mágicamente en todas las cosas
        si llega a ser presa de un gran exceso, y hacerlo con las cosas que el alma
        le prescriba. Pues el alma hállase entonces tan ansiosa de las cosas
        que quiete realizar, que espontáneamente aprovecha la hora sideral más
        significativa y más favorable, la cual gobierna también las cosas que mejor
        convengan a ello. .. y así es el alma que apetece las cosas con mayor
        intensidad la que las hace más efectivas y más semejantes a lo que luego
        resulta. .. de manera similar se produce todo cuanto el alma apetece con
        deseo intenso. Todo lo que el alma hace con ese fin, posee energía motriz
        y eficiencia para lo que ella anhela"
        
        "Todos
        tenemos ciertos poderes eléctricos y magnéticos dentro de nosotros,
        y ejercemos, como el imán, una fuerza de atracción o de repulsión,
        según que entremos en contacto con algo homogéneo o heterogéneo"
        
        (...) todos los números de 1 a 9 son "sagrados", así como
        el 10, 12, 13, 14, 28, 32 y 40 tienen un significado especial.
        
        Las potencias eficientes
        (numinosas) de lo inconsciente son los arquetipos.
        
        La gran
        mayoría de los fenómenos de sincronicidad espontáneos que tuve
        ocasión de observar y analizar permitieron reconocer sin dificultad
        su relación directa con el arquetipo.
        
        El principio de sincronicidad afirma
        que los miembros de una coincidencia significativa están vinculados
        por la simultaneidad y el significado.
        
        La sede de la sincronicidad no está, afirma, en los planetas,
        sino en la tierra, pero no en la materia, sino precisamente en
        el anima telluris.
        
        "el alma obedece a
        sus propias leyes, lo mismo que el cuerpo a las suyas, pero ambos
        concuerdan en virtud de la armonía preestablecida entre todas las
        substancias, dado que todas ellas son representaciones del mismo
        universo"
        
        Está aquí claramente expresado el pensamiento de
        que el hombre es un microcosmos. Las almas en general, dice Leibniz,
        "son los espejos o imágenes vivientes del universo de las cosas
        creadas". El distingue, por una parte, los espíritus, que son
        "imágenes de la divinidad" y "capaces de comprender el sistema
        del universo y de imitar una parte del mismo con pruebas constructivas,
        puesto que cada espíritu es dentro de su ámbito una
        pequeña divinidad"54; y por la otra los cuerpos, que actúan
        "conforme a las leyes de las causas finales mediante apeticiones,
        fines y medios"
        
        La filosofía china, en cambio, a partir de la connotación de lo
        mágico produjo el "concepto" de Tao y no una ciencia natural
        basada en la causalidad.
        La sincronicidad presupone un significado que es a priori
        con respecto a la conciencia humana, y que parece existir fuera
        del hombre
        
        El "saber absoluto", es decir, el conocimiento que no ha
        sido alcanzado a través de ningún órgano sensorial, que caracteriza
        al fenómeno sincronístico, confirma la hipótesis de un significado
        o sentido existentes de por sí, o incluso expresa su existencia. Una
        forma tal de existencia sólo puede ser trascendental, dado que,
        como lo demuestra el conocimiento de hechos futuros o espacialmente
        lejanos, se encuentra en un espacio y un tiempo psíquicamente
        relativos, es decir, en un continuo espacio-temporal irrepresentable.
        
        La sincronicidad no es más enigmática o misteriosa que los
        discontinuos de la física.
        
        Coincidences are also a kind of message. By paying attention to
        life’s coincidences, you can learn to hear their messages more clearly.
        
        When you live your life with an appreciation of coincidences and their
        meanings, you connect with the underlying field of infinite possibilities. This is
        when the magic begins. This is a state I call synchrodestiny, in which it becomes
        possible to achieve the spontaneous fulfillment of our every desire.
        Synchrodestiny requires gaining access to a place deep within yourself, while at
        the same time awakening to the intricate dance of coincidences out in the
        physical world. It requires understanding the profound nature of things,
        recognizing the wellspring of intelligence that endlessly creates our universe,
        and yet having the intention to pursue specific opportunities for change as they
        appear.
        
        Seeing the web of coincidence in our lives, however, is just the first stage in
        understanding and living synchrodestiny.
        
        The next stage is to develop an
        awareness of coincidences while they are happening. It is easy to see them in
        hindsight, but if you catch coincidences at the moment they occur, you are better
        positioned to take advantage of the opportunities they may be presenting. Also,
        awareness translates into energy. The more attention you give to coincidences,
        the more likely they are to appear, which means you begin to gain greater and
        greater access to the messages being sent to you about the path and direction of
        your life.
        
        We consciously shape our destinies into the limitlessly creative expressions they
        were meant to be, and by doing so we live out our most profound dreams,
        moving closer to enlightenment.
        
        Jung coined the word to describe what he called “temporally coincident occurrences of acausal events” or  “meaningful coincidence” and “acausal parallelism in which archetypes and the collective unconscious are governing a dynamic that underlies the whole of human experience and history — social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual.  


      Synchronicity does not admit causality in the analogy between terrestrial events and astrological constellations … What astrology can establish are the analogous events, but not that either series is the cause or the effect of the other. (For instance, the same constellation may at one time signify a catastrophe and at another time, in the same case, a cold in the head.) … In any case, astrology occupies a unique and special position among the intuitive methods… I have observed many cases where a well-defined psychological phase, or an analogous event, was accompanied by a transit (particularly when Saturn and Uranus were affected). – Carl G. Jung

     Jung’s paradigmatic example of a synchronicity occurred during a therapy session, and the connecting meaning in a synchronistic event is subjective, related to the individual’s psychological maturation, or individuation. Jung and Pauli believed, events like this occur too often enough to be only meaningless coincidence. Jung noted taking as usual phenomenological stance, while it would be “absurd” to consider the conjunction of dream material and life events to be causal, “it is wise to consider the fact that [these coincidences] do happen…The East…considers coincidences as the reliable basis of the world rather than causality. Synchronism is the prejudice of the East; causality is the modern prejudice of the West.”

     Jung mentioned the concept again in his commentary to Wilhelm’s translation of “The Secret of the Golden Flower”. He concluded that “the causality principle” cannot explain “psychic parallelisms” that must somehow be connected but are not causally related and equated synchronicity with the Chinese Tao. Jung would write about this concept again, and when he did, his focus would shift from the empirical and phenomenological aspects of synchronistic phenomena to the ontological and archetypal nature of such events. Pauli thought that the probabilistic nature of quantum theory and the Uncertainty Principle offered the possibility of discovering something beyond the mind-matter gap which transformed Jung’s understanding of synchronicity. As a result of his interaction with Pauli, Jung gradually came to see this non-causal connecting principle as an explanatory theory must be seen in combination with causality to lead to a better understanding reality, rather than having only a subjective meaning.
        
        Synchronicity is the coming together of inner and outer events in a way that cannot be explained by cause and effect and that is meaningful to the observer.
         ~ Carl Jung
